## Fundamental Types
C++ most common types that can be used to hold the data are:
* A Boolean type (**bool**)
* Character types (such as **char** and **wchar_t**)
* Integer types (such as **int** and **long long**)
* Floating types (such as **double** and **long double**)
* A type **void** to signify the absence of information
* Pointer types (such as int \* )
* Array types (such as **char[]**)
* Reference types (such as **double&** and **vector\<int\>&**)
* User-defined type (such as **struct**, **class**, **enum**)

`char ch='a';` hold a character of the implementation's character set.
